# MidiPolySynth

- ADSR added possibly something off with Decay, possibly

- added sawtooth and smoother transitions between notes, but pushing in the very real case I ruin everything 

- Stopped trying to make my own ADSR and used the standard juce one, fixed issue with clearing notes when ADSR is not active, for tomorrow add ADSR controls. 

- Fixed little conversion errors

- Added "decay" even though thats the wrong word.

- Last repo destroyed due to the destruction of almost all the files, now organised into better .h files AND currently just a square wavetable that is set up to make 
sound.
